### Summary
This is a project from my college for Computer Graphics course. The project is making a game using Unity. So I decided to make an endless runner game with 3D concept. To make it simple, I only add 3 level to the game.

### How To Play
To play this game, you need to avoid all the trees. To do that, you need to use the **LEFT** and **RIGHT** arrow keys or the **A** and **D** keys to move the player. Also, you can't jump or do anything else.

After finishing the level, you can wait to take the next level and after finishing the last level, you can restart the game again. Good luck and have fun!.
